Here, the experiment we labelled \"small\" has a date stamp that goes back to 2010. The output of that experiment seems similar to the output generated by `htseq`, or by `STAR`. However, neither of these software packages existed back then, so it's difficult to figure out what the values reported there actually mean.\n",
